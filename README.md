# factset_code_exercise
The program picks a random number from 1 to 10. The user gets three guesses. As soon as the user enters the correct number the program writes a winning message and exits. If the user fails to enter the correct number in three guesses, the program writes a failure message and exits. The program also writes "cold" when the guess is 3 or more away from the correct answer, "warm" when the guess is 2 away, and "hot" when the guess is 1 away
